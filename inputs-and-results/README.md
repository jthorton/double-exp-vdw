# Inputs and Results

This directory contains the main input files required to reproduce the performed optimizations and benchmarks
which were carried out while training the Sage line of OpenFF force fields.

The individual `optimizations` and `benchmarks` sub-directories contain detailed instructions on how the
input scripts and files should be used.
