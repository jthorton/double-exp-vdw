"# Before entering the data, there must be one line with column headings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Allowed column headings are: (not case sensitive),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# T : Temperature in Kelvin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# P : Pressure in specified unit (append atm or bar), default is atm",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# MBAR : Include this state in multistate Bennett acceptance ratio calculation (more extreme states are not included),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Rho : Density in kg m^-3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Hvap : Enthalpy of vaporization in kJ/mol.  Note: simulating liquid at 1 atm is an acceptable approximation for the vapor pressure.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Alpha : Thermal expansion coefficient in 10^-4 K^-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Kappa: Isothermal compressibility in 10^-6 bar^-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Cp: Isobaric heat capacity in kJ/mol K^-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Eps0: Static dielectric constant.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Rho_wt : Weight to use for this phase point. Analogous for Hvap etc. If column is missing then all weights are 1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Cvib_intra : To be ADDED to the calculated enthalpy of vaporization ; energy difference due to intramolecular vibrational frequency shifts in going from gas to liquid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Cvib_inter : To be ADDED to the calculated enthalpy of vaporization ; energy difference due to intermolecular vibrational frequency shifts in going from gas to liquid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# Cni : To be ADDED to the calculated enthalpy of vaporization ; accounts for the nonideality of the gas phase (more relevant close to critical point),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# dEvib : To be ADDED to the calculated heat capacity.  Note that these values are slightly different from the TIP4P-Ew paper for some reason.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# NOTE : To finish off the optimization I increased the weight of rho and alpha on the low temperature points.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
