# Additional Training

This folder contains the inputs and results of additional training runs for bonded and non-bonded properties.

Training runs and their description:

1. `water-non-bonded`: Training the DE non-bonded parameters of a 4 point water model starting from a B68 derived model.
2. `bonded-14`: Training of the bonded parameters of the DE force field including the optimisation of the 1-4 scaling term applied to torsion non-bonded interactions.
3. `sage-bonded`: Training of the bonded terms of an LJ based force field to the reduced set of targets used to train DE for comparison purposes.
