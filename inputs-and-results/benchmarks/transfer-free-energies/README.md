# Transfer free energies

Scripts required to run the aqueous / non-aqueous solvation free energies with the `absolv` package are included.

- `setup-transfer.py`: Build the schemas and directories required by `absolv` to run the solvation calculations, this also sets the lambda scaling.
- `run-calculation.py`: Run the calculation given a directory path.

# Results
Aggregated results of the DE-FF solvation/transfer free energy calculation are included as csv files due to the size of the individual outputs.
