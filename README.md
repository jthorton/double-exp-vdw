Double exponential vdW functional form 
======================================

This repository contains the scripts, inputs and the results generated as part of the study **A transferable double exponential potential for condensed phase simulation of small molecules.**

### Structure

This repository is structured into four main directories:

* `data-set-curation` - contains the scripts used to curate the training and test data sets as well as the final test sets.

* `inputs-and-results` - contains the *most up to date* input files required to reproduce this study and the associated output files.
  
* `scripts` - contains the scripts used to generate the input schemas / files, and scripts which perform ancillary data 
  analysis.

### Experimental Data Sets

The experimental data sets used in this project were curated from the [NIST ThermoML](https://trc.nist.gov/ThermoML.html)
archive [FreeSolv](https://github.com/MobleyLab/FreeSolv) and the [Minnesota Solvation Database](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/213300).
