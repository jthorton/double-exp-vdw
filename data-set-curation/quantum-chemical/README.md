# Quantum Chemical Data Sets

This directory contains the scripts used to curate the different quantum chemical *training* sets from
data stored in the [QCArchive](https://qcarchive.molssi.org/), as well as the final curated data sets.

**Note**: As the QCArchive is a constantly evolving and updating collection it is possible that running the
          scripts provided here will yield slightly different curated collections depending on if new results
          have become available. For full reproducibility we have in the `data-sets` directory provided JSON
          records which encode the **exact** ids of QC record used during training.
