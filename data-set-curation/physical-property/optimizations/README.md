# Physical Property Optimization Data Sets

Within this directories are the scripts used to curate the experimental density and enthalpy of mixing physical 
property data sets that the vdW force field parameters were trained against.

The data is sourced from the [ThermoML archive](https://www.nist.gov/mml/acmd/trc/thermoml) using the 
`openff-evaluator` packages data curation tools.
