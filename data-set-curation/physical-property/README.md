# Physical Property Data Sets

Within these directories are the scripts used to curate the experimental physical property
data sets that the DE-FF parameters were trained (`optimizations/`) and tested (`benchmarks/`) 
against.

All data sets were curated using the utilities provided by the [openff-evaluator](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-evaluator) package and stored
for easy access in both [nonbonded](https://github.com/SimonBoothroyd/nonbonded) data set objects and pandas csv files.

Instructions for curating the sets can be found in each of the sub-directories.
